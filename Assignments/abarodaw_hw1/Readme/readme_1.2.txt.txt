# DESCRIPTION - 1.2:
Write a python program to find the inverse kinematics of 3-link manipulator. The program takes derivatives and inverse of a matrix after which we get Theta1_dot, Theta2_dot and Theta3_dot. 

# ENVIRONMENT USED:
JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition


# LIBRARIES USED:
Install the following library through the Pycharm IDE. Type the library name and if the IDE doesn't detect it, there will be a yellow line below the library name. Hover over the yellow line and option will pop up to install the library/package.
