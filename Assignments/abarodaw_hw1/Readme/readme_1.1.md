# DESCRIPTION - 1.1:
Write a python program to plot the 2D Trajectory of a car with respect to point O given on the rear-wheel drive car. We are given the drive speed (W), radius of the wheel (r), distance between the front and rear wheels (L), steering angle (A), Orientation (fi) and duration (T). Also, none of the wheels slip and Wleft + Wright = 2W.


# ENVIRONMENT USED:
JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition


# LIBRARIES USED:
Install the following libraries through the Pycharm IDE. Type the library name and if the IDE doesn't detect it, there will be a yellow line below the library name. Hover over the yellow line and option will pop up to install the library/package.

1. numpy
2. math
3. matplotlib


# GETTING STARTED:
Install the necessary libraries to have the code set up for running. Taking the initial position (x,y) coordinates as 0, change values for fi and A to check the output. With fi=0 and A=0, the output will be a straight line in the (+y) direction. The duration T can also be changed to run the car for longer or shorter time.


# RUNNING THE CODE:
Click the play button on the top right corner or use the shortcut (Shift+F10).
A plot will be displayed for the trajectory in 2D.
