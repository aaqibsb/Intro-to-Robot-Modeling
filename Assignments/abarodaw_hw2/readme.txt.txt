# DESCRIPTION:
1.2
Write a python program to calculate the area covered by the camera on the drone. 

2.1
Write a python program to plot Si, Theta, Fi, Wx, Wy, Wz w.r.t global frame.

# ENVIRONMENT USED:
JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition


# LIBRARIES USED:
Install the following libraries through the Pycharm IDE. Type the library name and if the IDE doesn't detect it, there will be a yellow line below the library name. Hover over the yellow line and option will pop up to install the library/package.

1. numpy
2. sympy
3. math
4. matplotlib
5. pprint

# GETTING STARTED:
Install the necessary libraries to have the code set up for running. Follow the respective steps mentioned below for each problem.

1.2
Enter the values of euler angles Si, Theta, Fi and displacement dx, dy, dz. A plot of the area will be displayed and the equation of the ellipse and respective area will be computed.

2.1
Just run the code to get the output. A plot will be displayed for input values Si=35 deg, T=15 deg, Fi= 20 deg.
